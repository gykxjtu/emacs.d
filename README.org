** For MacOS X
   Since =pdf-tools= is not officially supported on MacOS X, you can
   set comment the following codes in =.emacs.d/elisp/init-config.el=
   to avoid errors during compiling on your Mac.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (unless (eq system-type 'darwin)
    ;; MacOS X is not officially supported.
    (use-package pdf-tools
      :ensure t
      :config (progn
		(pdf-tools-install))))
#+END_SRC
